## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media-Query

### What I learned

- I have recapped one of the important CSS layout techniques, which is felxbox.
- I used media query to make the website be responsive.

### Continued development

- Though I understand the basics of media query, I found it very time consuming to code it. I wish to develop my CSS skills further to a point that I could finish coding a simple website like this in 1 hour, including responsiveness of the website.
